## 3rd & Active vs Passive

The first person should only be used to express an opinion, a choice, a preference, etc.  
The second person can be used to give instructions, but it is not recommended,
unless it is the imperative mood.

The passive voice should be preferred over the active one to omit pronouns.  
Example:

```text
I load the data when the app is ready -> The data are loaded when the app is ready.
```

## Vectorial images

It is recommended to use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) when creating schemas, graphs, ... .

There is plugins for the following IDEs:

- Visual Studio Code: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio>
- JetBrains IDE: <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15635-diagrams-net-integration>

> These files should have a `drawio.svg` extension.
