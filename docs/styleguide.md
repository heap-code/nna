## Compliance

The project conforms to the style guide if all the rules described therein are respected.
The same applies to the styleguide extensions of the applications.

if, for a given code format, there is no rule in the styleguide, it is either :

1. Not restricted
2. Missing in the styleguide, in which case the styleguide must be updated.

## Eslint

A lot of rules are already defined with _eslint_.
They are considered as part of the styleguide.

The following sections are rules that it cannot enforce (yet).

## Global

The following sections are applied to almost any files of the project.

### Ordering

The ordering helps to highlight or to search code.
It also avoids conflicts with _git_.

> Always prefer the alphabetical order if none other order takes place.

## TODO

```bash
npx markdown-toc -i
